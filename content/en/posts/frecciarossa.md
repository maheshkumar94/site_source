As you may know, in 2022, I went on a long-awaited trip to Florence. This is my attempt at putting my expectations, experience, and thoughts to "paper". In this post, I want to talk about a _long_ train journey that I took on this, my first trip in Europe.

### Waking up

We begin this trip with an early morning from Paris Gare-de-Lyon station. 

And I mean _really_ early. 
7:30 AM departure early. 
5 AM shower, shave, and shit early. 

Now those of you who know me, know that I don't like many things, and waking up early is _definitely_ one of them. Welp, already off to a great start.

Local transpo. Mercifully, things went off without a hitch at this stage. We got a cab ('Merica! fuck yeah!) to the station pretty easily, and our driver was incredibly helpful by idiot-proofing the directions he gave us. And the check in for the train itself was smoother than a baby's butt - simple apple wallet tap action at the station and on we board. Woohoo! 

## The journey

Sure, we could've just taken a flight to Florence. That might just have been the logical and quickest way to get there. 

But trains are just so magical! Also, just a little eco friendly. America has conditioned the use of public transportation out of me, but I'm damned if I don't try going back to my roots. 

I may have neither my thepla and tomato chutney, nor the sing-song chaiwala, but this was to be  2022 Italian version of my beloved Kurla Express.

### Europe's train network 

Europe's train network is, in some ways, the best part of the continent. Because everywhere is so interconnected, flying almost seem like an archaic mode of travel. Taking an hour or so to get to the airport, and then going through fucking security for another hour, and then sitting in a cheap ass Ryanair flight (with barely a seat to speak of) - vs catching a train right in the middle of the city with basically the same (if not better) level of comfort? You decide what's better.

Now, you might be thinking - "Damn, aeroplanes are for losers! Choo-choo me all the way, baby!", but hold your iron horses there, dear reader. There are a few things to bear in mind as you decide to make this journey.

For one, there is no single place where you can book your tickets for your preferred itinerary. SCNF in France, Trenitalia for Italy, Thalys for Belgium / Netherlands, and those are just the ones I dealt with on this trip. Who knows what travel to Spain or Germany is like. Having to deal with multiple ticketing companies, with varying levels of support for digital wallets, accepted credit cards, and general amenities onboard isn't something you should have to deal with. First world problems, amirite? 

And for another, even if you manage to work out *where* to book your tickets, you're still left with the mostly daytime trains for long trips. In my case, we had to spend most of our day in the train to Milan, hurry up and wait for our transfer to Florence, and then another 3 hours to get there. I don't know about you, but something about spending my hours trapped indoors while the literal world passes you by, felt so _2020._

### Length of journey

As I said before, Paris to Florence was a 10 hour train journey.
*One way*. 

Of course, I am no stranger to long train rides, having grown up with Bangalore to Bombay / Bangalore to Ahmedabad train journeys for almost every summer vacation. I was a kid with one of those "brick game" thingies, the spectacular train staple meal of theplas and tomato chutney, and the endless (and mindless) giggling with my sister. Time just *flew by*. So how’d we fare this time? (hahah. Fare.)

Brick Game. The bootleg, jayanagar 4th block version of what I now know as Tetris. Pretty sure my mum just bought me those things to shut me up, or to take my attention and focus away from constantly asking how long it’d be before we arrived at our destination. Well, she deserved a break too, the poor woman.

With adulthood in the 21st century, comes a constant need of overstimulation. And with that, may I please present the 2022 equivalent of the brick game.

This. This wonderful invention is the cure to my airplane claustrophobia. My tonic to travel torture. Honestly, just put some nice video games in front of me and I’m a happy guy.

Luckily, all the trains came with in seat power, ample table space, and great WiFi! I spent quite a bit of the journey playing…

Train Simulator!

No, just kidding. It was Assassin’s Creed 2 all the way! I _WAS_ going to Florence, after all. Had to psych myself up for this trip, which was almost 10 years in the making. 


#### Munchies

Growing up in a family that LOVED its Gujarati food, we mostly stuck to having the basics for our train meals. Theplas, tomato chutney, and a decent bundle of sweets and snacks. That shit travelled *well.* And you never know with Indian railway food. One unfortunate bite, and it’s like that scene from Delhi Belly. You know the one. 

Now, pesto sandwiches, railway station pizzas, and croissants are not the same as mum’s lovely thepla and tomato chutney. But I did trade suspiciously sweet chai for several *espressi!* More JitterJuice™️ for me, please and thank you.
