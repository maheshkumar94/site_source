Hi! My name is Mahesh. Currently, I work as a Business Intelligence Engineer at [Amazon](https://amazon.com). Iâ€™ve worked in BI, data analytics and data science roles in a number of different business domains, like e-commerce, supply chain and logistics, grocery, and finance.

In my personal time, I enjoy baking, live music shows, and flight sims. I am also currently teaching myself the drums, and learning Italian. (Read about my trip to Italy here!)

more to come.
